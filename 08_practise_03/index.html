						His first official release was Zhigan-Limon (Жиган-лимон), which featured one of his biggest hits, "Kolshchik" (Кольщик). It took him three years until he settled on the final version. 
					</p>
					<p class="section-text">
						A significant portion of Mikhail Krug's songs invoke the secret code of Russian prisons and the symbolism of prisoner tattoos. They describe the emotional emptiness and the despair of the prisoners who are separated from their families and loved ones. He also wrote many love songs, and songs about Tver.
					</p>
					<p class="section-text">
						Krug liked to associate with criminal elements, which inspired  his music and his diamond ring was a gift from the notorious criminal Khobot. In writing his songs, Krug used a 1924 dictionary of underworld slang, compiled by the NKVD.
